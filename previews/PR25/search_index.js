The default value of id depends on other options.\nIf shuffle is true, shuffle the order in which top-level testsets within a given module are run, as well as the list of passed modules.\nIf recursive is true, the tests for all the recursive submodules of the passed modules mod are also run.\nThe static keyword controls testsets filtering: if true, only testsets which are known to match \"statically\" the passed patterns, i.e. at filtering time, are run. See docstring of interpolated for more details.\nIf dup is true, multiple toplevel testsets can have the same description. If false, only the last testset of a \"duplicate group\" is kept. The default is false in order to encourage having unique descriptions (useful for filtering) but also and mostly to play well with Revise. This keyword applies only to newly added testsets since the last run.\nWhen load is true, for each package module Mod which is selected, retest attempts to also select a corresponding Main.ModTests module with the same pattern specification, unless such module is already explicitly passed as an argument. If this test module doesn't already exist, retest attempts first to include into Main the corresponding test file \"test/ModTests.jl\" which is assumed, if it exists, to define one or more test modules (typically ModTests); these new test modules are associated to Mod (they inherit its pattern specification as above), and are cached and used again on subsequent invocations.\nIf seed is provided, it is used to seed the global RNG before running the tests.\n\nFiltering\n\nIt's possible to filter run testsets by specifying one or multiple patterns. A testset is guaranteed to run only if it \"matches\" all passed patterns (conjunction). Even if a testset is run, its nested testsets might not run if they don't match the patterns. Moreover if a testset is run, its enclosing testset, if any, also has to run (although not necessarily exhaustively, i.e. other nested testsets might be filtered out).\n\nA pattern can be a string, a Regex, an integer, an array or a tuple. For a testset to \"match\" an array, it must match at least one of its elements (disjunction). To match a tuple, it must match all of its elements (conjunction). To match an integer, its ID must be equal to this integer (cf. the id keyword).\n\nA pattern can also be the \"negation\" of a pattern, via the not function, which allows to exclude testsets from being run. As a special case, the negation of an integer can be expressed as its arithmetic negation, e.g. not(3) is equivalent to -3.\n\nPatterns can also be created via reachable, interpolated and depth.\n\nRegex filtering\n\nThe \"subject\" of a testset is the concatenation of the subject of its parent @testset, if any, with \"/$description\" where description is the testset's description. For example:\n\n@testset \"a\" begin # subject == \"/a\"\n    @testset \"b\" begin # subject is \"/a/b\"\n    end\n    @testset \"c$i\" for i=1:2 # subjects are \"/a/c1\" & \"/a/c2\"\n    end\nend\n\nWhen pattern isa a Regex, a testset is guaranteed to run only when its subject  matches pattern. Moreover, even if a testset matches (e.g. \"/a\" above with pattern == r\"a$\"), its nested testsets might be filtered out if they don't also match (e.g. \"a/b\" doesn't match pattern).\n\nIf a passed pattern is a string, then it is wrapped in a Regex with the \"case-insensitive\" flag, and must match literally the subjects. This means for example that \"a|b\" will match a subject like \"a|b\" or \"A|B\", but not like \"a\" (only in Julia versions >= 1.3; in older versions, the regex is simply created as Regex(pattern, \"i\")).\n\nAs a special case, if a string pattern starts with the '-' character, it's interpreted as the negation of the pattern corresponding to the string with '-' chopped off, e.g. \"-abc\" is equivalent to not(\"abc\"). Unless the string starts with two '-' characters, in which case the first '-' is chopped off, e.g. \"--abc\" will match subjects such as \"123-abc\". To negate such a pattern, just use not, e.g. not(\"--abc\").\n\nPer-module patterns\n\nIn addition to modules or patterns, positional arguments of retest can also be a pair of the form mod => pattern: then pattern is used to filter only testsets from mod; if other \"standalone\" patterns (not attached to a module) are specified, they also conjunctively apply to mod. For example, a call like retest(mod1 => 1:3, mod2, \"x\") is equivalent to retest(mod1 => (1:3, \"x\"), mod2 => \"x\"). If recursive is true, pattern is also applied to all recursive submodules sub of mod; if sub is also specified as sub => subpat, the patterns are merged, i.e. this is equivalent to specifying sub => (pattern, subpat).\n\nnote: Note\nthis function executes each (top-level) @testset block using eval within the module in which it was written (e.g. mod, when specified).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#ReTest.not","page":"ReTest.jl","title":"ReTest.not","text":"not(pattern)\n\nCreate an object suitable for filtering testsets (in the retest function), which \"negates\" the meaning of pattern: a testset matches not(pattern) if and only if it doesn't match pattern.\n\nFor example not(\"a\") matches any testset whose subject doesn't contain \"a\", and not(1:3) matches all the testsets but the first three of a module.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#ReTest.interpolated","page":"ReTest.jl","title":"ReTest.interpolated","text":"interpolated\n\nSingleton pattern which matches any testset whose subject can be interpolated \"statically\", i.e. at filtering time before testset are actually run. Non-inferrable subjects include those constructed from descriptions containing interpolated values which can't be known until run time. This pattern has an effect closely related to that of the static keyword of retest, discussed below, which is probably more generally useful.\n\nExamples\n\nGiven these testset:\n\n@testset \"outer\" verbose=true begin\n    @test true\n    inner = \"inner\"\n    @testset \"$inner\" begin\n        @test true\n    end\nend\n@testset \"other\" begin\n    @test true\nend\n\nWe get:\n\njulia> retest(\"other\", dry=true)\nMain\n1| outer\n2|   \"$(inner)\"\n3| other\n\njulia> retest(\"other\", dry=false)\n            Pass\nouter   |      1\nother   |      1\nMain    |      2\n\njulia> retest(\"other\", dry=true, interpolated)\nMain\n3| other\n\nWithout interpolated, retest can't decide at filtering time whether the \"inner\" testset will run, so must mark the \"outer\" testset as having to run. At run time, \"inner\" is not run because it doesn't match the pattern, but \"outer\" still had to run to determine this. With the interpolated pattern, \"inner\" is filtered out and retest selects only testsets which are statically known to have to run.\n\nSo again, interpolated doesn't have the same effect at filtering time (like when dry=true) and at run time. For example, one can see the list of non-interpolated subjects as follows with dry=true, but not run them (because everything is interpolated at run time):\n\njulia> retest(not(interpolated), dry=true)\n1| outer\n2|   \"$(inner)\"\n\njulia> retest(not(interpolated), dry=false)\n            Pass\nMain:\n  outer |      1\n\nstatic keyword\n\nUnlike interpolated, the static keyword of retest, when true, filters out only testsets which can't be proven to have to run at filtering time, let's call them \"undecidable\". It can have sometimes the same effect as when using interpolated, e.g. retest(\"other\", dry=true, static=true) and retest(\"other\", dry=true, interpolated) give the same result.\n\nBut in some cases we might want to filter out noisy testsets whose subjects can't be interpolated, but still include those which are relevant. For example, assume we want to run testsets 1 and 2, while excluding other testsets with uninterpolated subjects:\n\njulia> retest(1:2, dry=true, interpolated)\nMain\n1| outer\n\njulia> retest(1:2, dry=true, static=true)\nMain\n1| outer\n2|   \"$(inner)\"\n\nThe solution with interpolated is not what we want, as we specifically want testset 2 to run. Given the filtering specifications (1:2 here), the filtering algorithm can determine that 2 should run even though its subject is unknown at this point.\n\nGiven a filtering specification, there are three kind of testsets:\n\n\"undecidable\" (see above)\n\"match\": they are known statically to have to run\n\"nomatch\": they are known statically to not have to run\n\nThe default value of the static keyword is nothing, which means to run testsets which are not known with certainty to not match, i.e. \"match\" and \"undecidable\" testsets. As seen above, when static == true, only \"match\" testsets are run. When static == false, the behavior is the opposite: only \"undecidable\" testsets are run. Of course, other combinations involving \"nomatch\" testsets can be had by reversing the filtering pattern via not.\n\nFor example, to get the equivalent to the not(interpolated) example above, but with an effect which persists at run time (dry = false), you can use static = false together with the match-all regex pattern r\".*\", which will mark the \"inner\" testset as \"undecidable\" (the algorithm inspects slightly patterns just to recognize the simple match-all patterns \"\" and r\"\", but won't detect that r\".*\" would match \"$(inner)\"):\n\njulia> retest(r\".*\", static=false, dry=true)\nMain\n1| outer\n2|   \"$(inner)\"\n\njulia> retest(r\".*\", static=false, dry=false)\n               Pass\nMain:\n  outer    |      2\n    inner  |      1\n\nOne example of a rare case where a given testset is not in a single of the above three categories is as follows:\n\n@testset \"a\" begin\n    x = 2\n    @testset \"b$(i==1 ? 1 : x)\" for i=1:2\n        @testset \"c\" begin\n            # subject is \"match\" at first iteration and\n            # \"undecidable\" at second iteration\n            @test true\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nOne thing to understand is that the \"identity\" of a testset is determined by a given occurrence of the @testset macro. In the example above, for either the patterns \"b\" or \"c\", the two inner testsets are both \"match\" and \"undecidable\". In this case, the filtering algorithm selects a testset to run if at least one iteration would lead to this decision. Here, if static=true the first iteration would run, and if static=false the second iteration would run. This results in the same selection whatever the value of static is.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"constant"},{"location":"#ReTest.reachable","page":"ReTest.jl","title":"ReTest.reachable","text":"reachable(pattern)\n\nCreate a filtering pattern which matches any testset matching pattern or whose parent testset, if any, matches reachable(pattern). In other words, if a testset matches pattern, all its recursive nested testsets will also match.\n\nWhen pattern::String, reachable(pattern) has the same effect as pattern, because the subject of a testset is contained in the subjects of all its nested testsets. So reachable is typically useful when pattern is an integer.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> module T\n       using ReTest\n       @testset \"a\" verbose=true begin\n           @test true\n           @testset \"b\" begin\n               @test true\n           end\n       end\n       @testset \"c\" begin\n           @test true\n       end\n       end;\n\njulia> retest(T, reachable(1), dry=true)\n1| a\n2|   b\n\njulia> retest(T, not(reachable(1)), dry=true)\n3| c\n\nNote that the algorithm for reachable is currently not optimized, i.e. it will match pattern against all parents of a testset until success, even when this match was already performed earlier (i.e. the result of matching against pattern is not cached).\n\nAlso, in the current implementation, the subject of a parent testset is inferred from the subject of a testset, by chopping off the last component, determined by the last occurrence of '/'. This has two consequences. It will produce incorrect results if the description of a testset contains '/', and also, with interpolated when the subject is \"unknown\" due to un-interpolated descriptions. Consider the following example:\n\njulia> module Fail\n       using ReTest\n       @testset \"a\" begin\n           x = 1\n           @testset \"b$x\" begin\n               @testset \"c\" begin end\n           end\n       end\n       end;\n\njulia> retest(Fail, reachable(1), verbose=9, dry=true)\n1| a\n2|   \"b$(x)\"\n3|     c\n\njulia> retest(Fail, reachable(interpolated), verbose=9, dry=true)\n1| a\n\nHere, both testsets with id 2 and 3 have an unknown subject (at filtering time), which prevents the algorithm to detect that one of their parents (testset 1) actually has an \"interpolated\" description.\n\nOn the other hand, even with these unknown subjects, something like reachable(\"a\") would work as expected:\n\njulia> retest(Fail, reachable(\"a\"), verbose=9, dry=true)\n1| a\n2|   \"b$(x)\"\n3|     c\n\njulia> retest(Fail, reachable(\"a\"), verbose=9, dry=true, static=true)\n1| a\n\ncompat: Julia 1.3\nThis function requires at least Julia 1.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#ReTest.depth","page":"ReTest.jl","title":"ReTest.depth","text":"depth(d::Integer)\n\nCreate a pattern which matches testsets at \"depth\" d.
